# DeepYield-ResNet 🌾

Deep learning framework for crop yield prediction using climate-derived indices and spatial-temporal datasets.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements deep learning models (ResNet-based architectures) to estimate crop yield using:

- Climate variables
- SPI / SPEI drought indices
- Farm-level data
- NetCDF (.nc) spatial datasets

The goal is to improve predictive performance and understand climate-yield relationships.
